# virtual_store_webapp
Asp.net core MVC web app done with .net core 3.1 which implements an online store for small businesses.
It's still a work in progress. In the future I will implement product filtering, pagination, product cart, statistics page on dashboard, form with formating support for product descriptions,etc ...
The app uses a MSSQL Server database and uses Identity for user management.
The web app is hosted at https://virtualstorewebapp20200317123024.azurewebsites.net .
Dashboard is in place and it's only accessible after loging in.
